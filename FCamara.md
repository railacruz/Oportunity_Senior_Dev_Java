# Oportunity_Senior_Dev_Java
Hello how are you? I'm Monica, I work at FCAMARA. We are a technology consultancy that is a benchmark in digital transformation for the largest e-commerce, tourism, retail, healthcare, logistics and port operations companies in Brazil. Our biggest differential is in our culture code and in how we select and train talents, with interdisciplinarity and creating high performance teams. To keep growing, we look for people with their profile and professional trajectory to be part of our team writing this success story. We want to get to know you, understand about your professional moment and give you more details about our opportunities. When can we talk?  Get to know our Culture Code to find out what it's really like to be a #SangueLaranja! https://pt.slideshare.net/FCamara_Consultoria/culture-code-60932552
